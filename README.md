## Abstract
Intense bunched beams in synchrotrons interact with their surroundings via wake fields. This interaction can lead to eigenmodes of the circulating bunches becoming unstable. We discuss head-tail instabilities as well as the coupling of head-tail modes with the resulting TMCI (transverse mode coupling instabilities). Common mitigation techniques are explained as well as the effect of space charge, i.e. the beam self-fields. In this context, selected results in recent research progress and open questions will be pointed out.
